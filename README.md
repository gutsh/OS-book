This is a fork of the source code for the 10th edition of
"Operating System Concepts" by Silberschatz/Galvin/Gagne.
Published by John Wiley & Sons 2018, downloaded from the Internet circa 2020.

I've been reading through this book doing some exercises, and came up with idea that I could write it more publicaly. So I've decided to fork sources repo and start writing everything here.

Tasks:
Current - rudimentary CPU scheduler.
